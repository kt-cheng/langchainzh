如何结合代理和向量库[#](#how-to-combine-agents-and-vectorstores "本标题的永久链接")
=================================================================

本文介绍如何结合代理和向量库。这样做的用例是，您已将数据摄入到向量库中，并希望以代理方式与其进行交互。

建议的方法是创建一个`RetrievalQA`，然后将其作为整体代理的工具。

让我们来看看如何在下面执行此操作。您可以使用多个不同的向量数据库执行此操作，并使用代理作为它们之间路由的方法。

有两种不同的方法可以做到这一点-您可以让代理像正常工具一样使用向量库，也可以设置`return_direct=True`，以实际将代理仅用作路由器。

创建向量库[#](#create-the-vectorstore "本标题的永久链接")
--------------------------------------------

```  python
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

```

```  python
from pathlib import Path
relevant_parts = []
for p in Path(".").absolute().parts:
    relevant_parts.append(p)
    if relevant_parts[-3:] == ["langchain", "docs", "modules"]:
        break
doc_path = str(Path(*relevant_parts) / "state_of_the_union.txt")

```

```  python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
loader = TextLoader(doc_path)
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
texts = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
docsearch = Chroma.from_documents(texts, embeddings, collection_name="state-of-union")

```

```  python
Running Chroma using direct local API.
Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.

```

```  python
state_of_union = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, chain_type="stuff", retriever=docsearch.as_retriever())

```

```  python
from langchain.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader

```

```  python
loader = WebBaseLoader("https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/faq/")

```

```  python
docs = loader.load()
ruff_texts = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
ruff_db = Chroma.from_documents(ruff_texts, embeddings, collection_name="ruff")
ruff = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, chain_type="stuff", retriever=ruff_db.as_retriever())

```
```  python
Running Chroma using direct local API.
Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.

```

创建代理[#](#create-the-agent "本标题的永久链接")
-------------------------------------

```  python
# Import things that are needed generically
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.agents import AgentType
from langchain.tools import BaseTool
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain import LLMMathChain, SerpAPIWrapper

```

```  python
tools = [
    Tool(
        name = "State of Union QA System",
        func=state_of_union.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about the most recent state of the union address. Input should be a fully formed question."
    ),
    Tool(
        name = "Ruff QA System",
        func=ruff.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about ruff (a python linter). Input should be a fully formed question."
    ),
]

```

```  python
# Construct the agent. We will use the default agent type here.
# See documentation for a full list of options.
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)

```

```  python
agent.run("What did biden say about ketanji brown jackson is the state of the union address?")

```

```  python
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
 I need to find out what Biden said about Ketanji Brown Jackson in the State of the Union address.
Action: State of Union QA System
Action Input: What did Biden say about Ketanji Brown Jackson in the State of the Union address?
Observation:  Biden said that Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds and that she will continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence.
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: Biden said that Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds and that she will continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence.

```  python
"Biden said that Jackson is one of the nation's top legal minds and that she will continue Justice Breyer's legacy of excellence."

```

```  python
agent.run("Why use ruff over flake8?")

```

```  python
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
 I need to find out the advantages of using ruff over flake8
Action: Ruff QA System
Action Input: What are the advantages of using ruff over flake8?
Observation:  Ruff can be used as a drop-in replacement for Flake8 when used (1) without or with a small number of plugins, (2) alongside Black, and (3) on Python 3 code. It also re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code quality tools natively, including isort, yesqa, eradicate, and most of the rules implemented in pyupgrade. Ruff also supports automatically fixing its own lint violations, which Flake8 does not.

仅将代理用作路由器[#](#use-the-agent-solely-as-a-router "本标题的永久链接")
----------------------------------------------------------

如果您打算将代理用作路由器并且只想直接返回RetrievalQAChain的结果，则还可以设置`return_direct=True`。

请注意，在上面的示例中，代理在查询RetrievalQAChain后执行了一些额外的工作。您可以避免这种情况，只需直接返回结果即可。

```  python
tools = [
    Tool(
        name = "State of Union QA System",
        func=state_of_union.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about the most recent state of the union address. Input should be a fully formed question.",
        return_direct=True
    ),
    Tool(
        name = "Ruff QA System",
        func=ruff.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about ruff (a python linter). Input should be a fully formed question.",
        return_direct=True
    ),
]

```

```  python
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)

```

```  python
agent.run("What did biden say about ketanji brown jackson in the state of the union address?")

多跳向量存储推理[#](#multi-hop-vectorstore-reasoning "此标题的永久链接")

由于向量存储器在代理中很容易使用，因此可以使用现有的代理框架回答依赖于向量存储器的多跳问题。

```  python
tools = [
    Tool(
        name = "State of Union QA System",
        func=state_of_union.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about the most recent state of the union address. Input should be a fully formed question, not referencing any obscure pronouns from the conversation before."

        func=ruff.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about ruff (a python linter). Input should be a fully formed question, not referencing any obscure pronouns from the conversation before."

agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)

```  python
agent.run("What tool does ruff use to run over Jupyter Notebooks? Did the president mention that tool in the state of the union?")

```

```  python
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
 I need to find out what tool ruff uses to run over Jupyter Notebooks, and if the president mentioned it in the state of the union.
Action: Ruff QA System
Action Input: What tool does ruff use to run over Jupyter Notebooks?
Observation:  Ruff is integrated into nbQA, a tool for running linters and code formatters over Jupyter Notebooks. After installing ruff and nbqa, you can run Ruff over a notebook like so: > nbqa ruff Untitled.ipynb
Thought: I now need to find out if the president mentioned this tool in the state of the union.
Action: State of Union QA System
Action Input: Did the president mention nbQA in the state of the union?
Observation:  No, the president did not mention nbQA in the state of the union.
Thought: I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: No, the president did not mention nbQA in the state of the union.

> Finished chain.

```

```  python
'No, the president did not mention nbQA in the state of the union.'
