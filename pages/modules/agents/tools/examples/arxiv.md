=============================================

本笔记本将介绍如何使用`arxiv`组件。

首先，您需要安装`arxiv` python软件包。

```
!pip install arxiv

```

```
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent, AgentType

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)
tools = load_tools(
    ["arxiv"], 
)

agent_chain = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
)

```

```
agent_chain.run(
    "What's the paper 1605.08386 about?",
)

```

```

I need to use Arxiv to search for the paper.

Title: Heat-bath random walks with Markov bases
Authors: Caprice Stanley, Tobias Windisch
Summary: Graphs on lattice points are studied whose edges come from a finite set of
allowed moves of arbitrary length. We show that the diameter of these graphs on
fibers of a fixed integer matrix can be bounded from above by a constant. We
then study the mixing behaviour of heat-bath random walks on these graphs. We
also state explicit conditions on the set of moves so that the heat-bath random
walk, a generalization of the Glauber dynamics, is an expander in fixed
dimension.
Thought:The paper is about heat-bath random walks with Markov bases on graphs of lattice points.
Final Answer: The paper 1605.08386 is about heat-bath random walks with Markov bases on graphs of lattice points.

ArXiv API封装器[#](#the-arxiv-api-wrapper "链接到此标题的永久链接")
-----------------------------------------------------

该工具包装了API封装器。下面，我们可以探索它提供的一些功能。

```
from langchain.utilities import ArxivAPIWrapper

```

运行一个查询以获取有关某篇`科学 文章`/文章的信息。查询文本限制为300个字符。

它返回这些文章字段：

* 出版日期

'Published: 2017-10-10\nTitle: On Mixing Behavior of a Family of Random Walks Determined by a Linear Recurrence\nAuthors: Caprice Stanley, Seth Sullivant\nSummary: We study random walks on the integers mod $G_n$ that are determined by an\ninteger sequence $\\{ G_n \\}_{n \\geq 1}$ generated by a linear recurrence\nrelation. Fourier analysis provides explicit formulas to compute the\neigenvalues of the transition matrices and we use this to bound the mixing time\nof the random walks.

An\nagreement of calculated fluxes with data on charged particles from the AMS and\nCAPRICE detectors is demonstrated. Predictions on neutrino fluxes at different\nexperimental sites are compared with results from other calculations.'
