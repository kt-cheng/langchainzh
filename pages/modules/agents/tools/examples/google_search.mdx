# 使用Google搜索组件

本教程将介绍如何使用Google搜索组件。

首先，您需要设置适当的API密钥和环境变量。
要设置它，请在[Google Cloud凭据控制台](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)中创建GOOGLE_API_KEY，
并使用[Programmable Search Enginge](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/create)创建GOOGLE_CSE_ID。
接下来，最好按照[这里](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37083058/programmatically-searching-google-in-python-using-custom-search)的说明操作。

然后，我们需要设置一些环境变量。

```python
import os
os.environ["GOOGLE_CSE_ID"] = ""
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = ""

```

```python
from langchain.tools import Tool
from langchain.utilities import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper

search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()

tool = Tool(
    name = "Google Search",
    description="Search Google for recent results.",
    func=search.run
)

```

```python
tool.run("Obama's first name?")

```

```python
"STATE OF HAWAII. 1 Child's First Name. (Type or print). 2. Sex. BARACK. 3. This Birth. CERTIFICATE OF LIVE BIRTH. FILE. NUMBER 151 le. lb. Middle Name.

```

# 结果数量

您可以使用`k`参数来设置结果数量。

```python
search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper(k=1)

tool = Tool(
    name = "I'm Feeling Lucky",
    description="Search Google and return the first result.",
    func=search.run
)

```

```python
tool.run("python")

```

```python
'The official home of the Python Programming Language.'

```

元数据结果

运行通过GoogleSearch查询并返回片段、标题和链接元数据。

* 片段：结果的描述。
* 标题：结果的标题。
* 链接：结果的链接。


```python
search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()

def top5_results(query):
    return search.results(query, 5)

tool = Tool(
    name = "Google Search Snippets",
    description="Search Google for recent results.",
    func=top5_results
)

```
