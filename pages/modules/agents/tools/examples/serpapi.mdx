SerpAPI[#](#serpapi "Permalink to this headline")
=================================================

本笔记介绍如何使用SerpAPI组件搜索网络。

```python
from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper

```

```python
search = SerpAPIWrapper()

```

```python
search.run("Obama's first name?")

```

```python
'Barack Hussein Obama II'

```

自定义参数[#](#custom-parameters "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------

您还可以使用任意参数自定义SerpAPI包装器。例如，在下面的示例中，我们将使用`bing`而不是`google`。

```python
params = {
    "engine": "bing",
    "gl": "us",
    "hl": "en",
}
search = SerpAPIWrapper(params=params)

```

```python
search.run("Obama's first name?")

```

```python
