MRKL

本文档展示了使用代理来复制MRKL链。

这里使用的是Chinook数据库示例。要设置它，请按照https：//database.guide/2-sample-databases-sqlite/上的说明进行操作，将 `.db `文件放在此存储库根目录的notebooks文件夹中。

```  python
from langchain import LLMMathChain, OpenAI, SerpAPIWrapper, SQLDatabase, SQLDatabaseChain
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.agents import AgentType
```

```  python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
search = SerpAPIWrapper()
llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain(llm=llm, verbose=True)
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:/../../../../../notebooks/Chinook.db")
db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(llm, db, verbose=True)
tools = [
    Tool(
        name = "Search",
        func=search.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. You should ask targeted questions"
    ),
    Tool(
        name="Calculator",
        func=llm_math_chain.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about math"
    ),
    Tool(
        name="FooBar DB",
        func=db_chain.run,
        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about FooBar. Input should be in the form of a question containing full context"
    )
]
```

```  python
mrkl = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)
```


```  python
mrkl.run("Who is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend? What is her current age raised to the 0.43 power?")

 I need to find out who Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend is and then calculate her age raised to the 0.43 power.
Action: Search
Action Input: "Who is Leo DiCaprio's girlfriend?"
Observation: DiCaprio met actor Camila Morrone in December 2017, when she was 20 and he was 43. They were spotted at Coachella and went on multiple vacations together.
