如何自定义对话记忆[#](#how-to-customize-conversational-memory "此标题的永久链接")
================================================================

本教程演示了几种自定义对话记忆的方法。

```
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

```

AI前缀[#](#ai-prefix "此标题的永久链接")
------------------------------

第一种方法是通过更改对话摘要中的AI前缀来实现。默认情况下，这个前缀设置为“AI”，但您可以将其设置为任何您想要的内容。请注意，如果您更改了这个前缀，您还应该更改用于链中的提示以反映这个命名更改。让我们在下面的示例中举个例子。

```
# Here it is by default set to "AI"
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm, 
    verbose=True, 
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory()
)

```

```
conversation.predict(input="Hi there!")

```

```
> Entering new ConversationChain chain...
Prompt after formatting:
The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: Hi there!
AI:

> Finished ConversationChain chain.

```

```
" Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?"

```

```
conversation.predict(input="What's the weather?")

```

```
> Entering new ConversationChain chain...
Prompt after formatting:
The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: Hi there!
AI: Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?
Human: What's the weather?
AI:

```

```
' The current weather is sunny and warm with a temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit. The forecast for the next few days is sunny with temperatures in the mid-70s.'

```

```
# Now we can override it and set it to "AI Assistant"
from langchain.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate

template = """The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

PROMPT = PromptTemplate(

conversation = ConversationChain(

    memory=ConversationBufferMemory(ai_prefix="AI Assistant")

```
conversation.predict(input="Hi there!")
