AutoGPT[#](#autogpt "这个标题的永久链接")，自动生成文本的 Python 程序
==========


该项目是 https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT 的实现，但使用了 LangChain 原语（ primitives ）（LLMs， PromptTemplates， VectorStores， Embeddings， Tools）



设置工具[#](#set-up-tools "这个标题的永久链接")
-------------------------------


我们将设置包含搜索工具、写文件工具和读文件工具的 AutoGPT





```python
from langchain.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper

from langchain.agents import Tool

from langchain.tools.file_management.write import WriteFileTool

from langchain.tools.file_management.read import ReadFileTool



search = SerpAPIWrapper()

tools = [

    Tool(

        name = "search",

        func=search.run,

        description="useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. You should ask targeted questions"

    ),

    WriteFileTool(),

    ReadFileTool(),

]



```

设置内存[#](#set-up-memory "这个标题的永久链接")
---------------------------------


这里的内存用于代理的中间步骤





```python
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

from langchain.docstore import InMemoryDocstore

from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings



```


```python
# Define your embedding model

embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# Initialize the vectorstore as empty

import faiss



embedding_size = 1536

index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embedding_size)

vectorstore = FAISS(embeddings_model.embed_query, index, InMemoryDocstore({}), {})



```

设置模型和 AutoGPT[#](#setup-model-and-autogpt "这个标题的永久链接")
---------------


初始化所有！我们将使用 ChatOpenAI 模型





```python
from langchain.experimental import AutoGPT

from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI



```


```python
agent = AutoGPT.from_llm_and_tools(

    ai_name="Tom",

    ai_role="Assistant",

    tools=tools,

    llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0),

    memory=vectorstore.as_retriever()

)

# Set verbose to be true

agent.chain.verbose = True



```

运行示例[#](#run-an-example "这个标题的永久链接")
-----------------------------------



这里我们将让它输出旧金山的天气报告





```python
agent.run(["write a weather report for SF today"])



```
```python
> Entering new LLMChain chain...

Prompt after formatting:

System: You are Tom, Assistant

Your decisions must always be made independently 

 without seeking user assistance. Play to your strengths 

 as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications. 

 If you have completed all your tasks, 

 make sure to use the "finish" command.



GOALS:



1. write a weather report for SF today





Constraints:

1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory. Your short term memory is short, so immediately save important information to files.

2. If you are unsure how you previously did something or want to recall past events, thinking about similar events will help you remember.

3. No user assistance

4. Exclusively use the commands listed in double quotes e.g. "command name"



Commands:

1. search: useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. You should ask targeted questions, args json schema: {"query": {"title": "Query", "type": "string"}}

2. write_file: Write file to disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}, "text": {"title": "Text", "description": "text to write to file", "type": "string"}}

3. read_file: Read file from disk, args json schema: {"file_path": {"title": "File Path", "description": "name of file", "type": "string"}}

4. finish: use this to signal that you have finished all your objectives, args: "response": "final response to let people know you have finished your objectives"



Resources:

1. Internet access for searches and information gathering.

2. Long Term memory management.

3. GPT-3.5 powered Agents for delegation of simple tasks.

4. File output.



Performance Evaluation:

1. Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities.

2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture behavior constantly.

3. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach.

4. Every command has a cost, so be smart and efficient. Aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps.



You should only respond in JSON format as described below
