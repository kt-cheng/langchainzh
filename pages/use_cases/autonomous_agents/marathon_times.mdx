使用AutoGPT找到马拉松比赛的获胜时间[#](#autogpt-example-finding-winning-marathon-times "永久链接")
===================================


* 实现自https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT
* 使用LangChain原语（ primitives ） (LLMs, PromptTemplates, VectorStores, Embeddings, Tools)





```python
# !pip install bs4

# !pip install nest_asyncio



```


```python
# General 

import os

import pandas as pd

from langchain.experimental.autonomous_agents.autogpt.agent import AutoGPT

from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI



from langchain.agents.agent_toolkits.pandas.base import create_pandas_dataframe_agent

from langchain.docstore.document import Document

import asyncio

import nest_asyncio





# Needed synce jupyter runs an async eventloop

nest_asyncio.apply()



```


```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", temperature=1.0)



```
设置工具[#](#set-up-tools "永久链接")
-------------------------------


* 我们将设置一个带有`search `工具的AutoGPT， 和`write-file`工具， 和一个`read-file`工具， 一个浏览网页的工具， 和一个通过python REPL与CSV文件交互的工具


请在下面定义任何其他要使用的`工具`:tools





```python

**使用PlayWright浏览网页**





```python
# !pip install playwright

# !playwright install



```


```python

> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Thought: The CSV file has already been read and saved into a pandas dataframe called `df`. Hence, I can simply display the data by printing the whole dataframe. Since `df.head()` returns the first 5 rows, I can use that to showcase the contents.



Action: python_repl_ast

Action Input: print(df.head())   Year                               Name Country     Time

0  2022                       Evans Chebet   Kenya  2:06:51

1  2021                     Benson Kipruto   Kenya  2:09:51

2  2020  Canceled due to COVID-19 pandemic     NaN      NaN

3  2019                   Lawrence Cherono   Kenya  2:07:57

4  2018                      Yuki Kawauchi   Japan  2:15:58



Observation: None

Thought:I used the wrong tool to perform the action. I should have used the given data and not interacted with the Python shell. I can now provide the displayed data as the answer since the information in the printed dataframe would look like a table when typed as text.



Final Answer: 

 Year Name Country Time

1 2021 Benson Kipruto Kenya 2:09:51
