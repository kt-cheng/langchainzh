SalesGPT - 你的上下文感知 AI 销售助手[#](#salesgpt-your-context-aware-ai-sales-assistant "Permalink to this headline")
=====================================


本文档演示了一种**上下文感知**的 AI 销售代理的实现。


本文档最初发表在 [filipmichalsky/SalesGPT](https://github.com/filip-michalsky/SalesGPT) 由 [@FilipMichalsky](https://twitter.com/FilipMichalsky)。


SalesGPT 是上下文感知的， 这意味着它可以理解销售对话的哪个部分，并相应地行动。


因此， 这个代理可以与潜在客户进行自然的销售对话，并根据对话阶段表现出不同行为。因此，本文档演示了如何使用 AI 自动化销售发展代表的活动，如外呼销售电话。


我们在这个实现中利用了 [`langchain`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) 库，并受到了 [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) 架构的启发。



导入库并设置环境[#](#import-libraries-and-set-up-your-environment "Permalink to this headline")
-----------------------------





```
import os



# import your OpenAI key -

# you need to put it in your .env file 

# OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-xxxx'



os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'sk-xxx'



from typing import Dict, List, Any



from langchain import LLMChain, PromptTemplate

from langchain.llms import BaseLLM

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from langchain.chains.base import Chain

from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI



```
### SalesGPT 架构[#](#salesgpt-architecture "Permalink to this headline")


1. 种子 SalesGPT 代理
2. Run Sales Agent

3. 运行销售阶段识别代理以识别销售代理所处的阶段，并相应调整其行为。




以下是体系结构的示意图：


### 架构图[#](#architecture-diagram "Permalink to this headline")

### 销售对话阶段。[#](#sales-conversation-stages "Permalink to this headline")




代理人使用一位助手来控制对话处于哪个阶段。这些阶段是由ChatGPT生成的，可以轻松修改以适应其他用例或对话模式。




1. 介绍:通过介绍自己和自己的公司来开始对话。在保持对话专业的同时，有礼貌并尊重。
2. 资格:确认对于您的产品/服务，他们是否是正确的联系人，并具有做出购买决策的权威。
3. 价值主张:简要解释您的产品/服务如何使潜在客户受益。专注于您产品/服务的独特卖点和价值主张，使其与竞争对手区分开。
4. 需求分析:询问开放性问题以发现潜在客户的需求和痛点。仔细听取他们的回答并做笔记。
5. 解决方案展示:基于潜在客户的需求，呈现您的产品/服务作为可以解决他们痛点的解决方案。
6. 异议处理：解决潜在客户可能对您的产品/服务提出的任何异议。准备好提供证据或推荐书来支持您的主张。
7. 结束谈话: 提出下一步行动建议，询问是否购买。可以是演示、试用或和决策者会面。一定要总结讨论的内容并重申好处。
